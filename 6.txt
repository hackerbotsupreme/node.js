we will talk about jsx (js extensions)
important topic 
<h1> hello world </h1>
this is jsx in react 
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello World!</h1>, document.getElementById('root'))// boom 


import React from 'react'; 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello World!</h1>, document.getElementById('root'))// boom 
well here why do we need this - import React from 'react';  
when we didnot used use why whould we keep it 
then if yu comment it ypu will see 
react must be in scope using jsx .

keep in mind ,
// var react = require('react');
// var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');//accesing the root from the one and only index.html through requiring dom 
// both are same 
import React from 'react'; //here we are not writing 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';// same here

both are same 





go to google , go to babel.io (js compiler )
go to  try it out , paste ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello World!</h1>, document.getElementById('root'))
 it will show you  how the code written iside the react a=is 
 actually getting compiled behind the scenes (how broswser looks it ).
 and also with this we can understand exactly how and why the code is as it is .
