pacakage.json is very important bcz it used to store the metadata associated with the project as well as to store 
the list of dependencies pacakages .means our project is dependent on thede things for example react version ... 
react-dom and scripts version .... and this is one of the most important things as this file makes it very easy to 
share this project with others  which means if anyone wants /needs to work onthis project he can see/check from this 
package.json which versions are used and install it
